				<p style="font-weight: 200;">
					Most efforts to provide affordable housing and otherwise improve the financial security of low-

income and disadvantaged people (and neighborhoods) involve significant amounts of wealth 

transfer—taking from the rich, and giving to the poor (at least in theory).  This general approach 

has many problems.
				</p>
					<p> 1. The wealth typically ends up being transferred back to those who are wealthy and

rarely becomes the wealth of the poor.</p>
					<p> 2. The wealth typically ends up being transferred back to those who are wealthy and

rarely becomes the wealth of the poor.</p>
					<p> 3. Dependence is Perpetuated rather than Improving Self-sufficiency.</p>
					<p> 4. A lot of wealth is destroyed in the process.</p>

				<h1 style="font-weight: 700; margin-top: 2em;">RON's Solution</h1>
				<p style="font-weight: 200;">
					The RON approach requires significantly less dollars to be transferred from the

wealthy, and the wealth that is transferred goes to the poor and helps them rapidly build assets 

and become self-sufficient. This is accomplished in several ways.
				</p>
					<p> 1. Less government money is required, so less is consumed by overhead, tax avoiding, and

political conflict.</p>
					<p> 2. Subsidies build assets of the poor (and help end their need for housing subsidies.</p>
					<p> 3. Home Values Appreciate Significantly in the First Few Years.</p>
					<p> 4. Residents of RONs are able to break the cycle of poverty and reduce the need for future

subsidies.</p>

				<h1 style="font-weight: 700; margin-top: 2em;">Creating Value through Supportive Financial Stakeholders</h1>
				
				<p style="font-weight: 200;">
					In the RON model, the financial stakeholders are committed to helping resident-owners to build

financial security and assets, not to extract profits from them.   In many previous attempts to 

increase home ownership, the corporations (and individual relators, title companies and others 

in the real estate/finance/mortgage system) were often seeking to maximize the profits they 

could make on people who were often poorly-educated and vulnerable.   This led to several bad 

things:
				</p>
					<p> 1. Homes were sold at inflated or “bubble” prices that benefited real estate speculators

but increased the risk that the value would drop and result in the owners being under 

water with negative equity.</p>
					<p> 2.People were sold non-traditional sub-prime mortgages that were good for the finance

and real estate industry profits but were bad for the people purchasing the homes (e.g. 

interest-only and adjustable-rate or ballooning mortgages).

rarely becomes the wealth of the poor.</p>
					<p> 3. Many of the fees were higher than would be appropriate and fair, exploiting the people

rather than helping them.</p>

				<h1 style="font-weight: 700; margin-top: 2em;">RON's Solution</h1>
				<p style="font-weight: 200;">
					the RON financial stakeholders are working to positively benefit the people who

would be purchasing the homes.
				</p>
					<p> 1.People will be purchasing homes that are within their means—perhaps not as nice as ones

sold in the early 2000s, but ones they can afford.</p>
					<p> 2. The homes will be intentionally sold with a plan for the residents to make improvements in

the first few years—with support—to keep the purchase price low and allow for accelerated 

appreciation due to sweat equity.</p>
					<p> 3. The mortgages will be low, fixed-rate mortgages (often with 15-year terms) and possibly

with an interest rate that is subsidized to keep it lower than market rates.
					<p> 4. The fees will be minimized.  The title work, the insurance, the appraisal and other similar

work will be done in an efficient way that keeps the fees low.
