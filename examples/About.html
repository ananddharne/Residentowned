">Foundational Principles</h1>

	<h1 id="linkone">Pathway to Ownership</h1>

	<p>To insure the success of home ownership, local philanthropic organizations will buy out properties at a low cost so they can sell them to residents at a reasonable price. The difference comes when the organizations focus their efforts on keeping housing affordable rather then trying to maximizing their profits. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition, residents will be able to  earn their down payment in their first year while still renting. It is a reasonable assumption that the targeted residents would typically have difficulty in getting the down payment together.  Rather than require that, the RON would have a program that would allow them to rent for the first year while they earn their down payment in the following ways.
	</p>
	<div class="box">
	<h2>Sweat Equity</h2>
	<br/>
	<p>Residents will work on projects to improve their own home, their neigbor's homes, the common space and the outdoor landscaping. While continuing to improve the community, residents will tracked and reviewed by the co-op committee.</p>
	<h2>Demonstrating Excellent Resident Citizenship</h2>
	<br/>
	<p>By showing comitment through paying rent on time, never missing a payment, following rules set by the neihborhood residents can manage to chip away at their down payments.
</p>
	<h2>Attending Home Ownership Training</h2>
	<br/>
	<p>Keeping good attendence and participating in the training program will not only give the knowlege and confidence needed to successfully pay of a home or property, but it will also be a way for the residents to earn their down payments.</p>
	<h2>Financial Management Training</h2>
	<br/>
	<p>Part of qualifying for the down payment would include participation in financial management training and getting set up with the designated credit union with a savings account and checking account. 
</p>
	<h2>Socially Connecting</h2>
	<br/>
	<p>Residens can get “bonus points” for participating in various social programs and events, including borrowing or loaning things via Neighborgoods.net or other platforms that begin to document a pattern of responsibility and reliability. </p>
	</div>
	<p>
	The lending organization (either the local philanthropic organizations or a separate group that is essentially managing the mortgages for the properties with the money from the philanthropic organizations) would not require a down payment.  Residents could take ownership at the start of the second year and just begin making regular monthly payments.
	</p>
	<p>
	Curabitur dui elit, tristique eget venenatis et, scelerisque mattis arcu. Pellentesque lectus orci, tempus in enim et, condimentum rutrum magna. Mauris nec eros viverra, facilisis nibh ut, sodales urna. Pellentesque nec neque in ipsum imperdiet egestas vitae vel augue. Integer felis eros, dictum at eleifend aliquet, lacinia non neque. Curabitur eget condimentum urna, eget sodales lectus. Maecenas blandit ac neque id elementum. Phasellus ultricies vestibulum elit ut sagittis. Nam ut porta mi.
	</p>


	<h1 id="linktwo">Innovating Neighborhoods</h1>

	<p>Focusing on a community neighborhood and adding in many innovations is more powerful than past efforts that just try to create ways for low income people to buy homes. Efforts focusing just on promoting home ownership can have unintended consequences and can be exploited by others (e.g. the sub-prime mortgage mess).  They don’t provide enough support and assists to improve the odds of success and value of the low-income people who can benefit from home ownership.  

	</p>
	<p>
	The proposed structure of the RON would include focusing on a  geographic area (perhaps 9-12 blocks) of primarily residential properties that are initially undervalued due to blight and where there are some abandoned homes and some properties that have been claimed by the cities.  It is likely that this includes some rental properties (some owned by distant “slumlords”) some apartments along with some resident-owned homes. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Local philanthropic organizations would purchase as many of the properties as possible, even if they have to pay a slight premium for some.  The city may assist the process by being extra rigid and tough in enforcing laws and regulations on rental properties to perhaps motivate the owners to sell them.  
	</p>
	<div class="box">
		<h2>The RON structure would have a combination of: 
		</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>Residents owning their own units (stand-alone house, duplex, row-house unit) or have a “condominium” approach where they would individually own their unit (including inside walls) and jointly own the shared space and outside walls.  If the apartments are sufficiently large, there could be an option for either ownership by a separate co-op for just those buildings or leaving them investor owned if the investor will commit to policies that allow for resident asset-building and other forms of cooperation.   In the latter case, the residents could still be allowed to become members of the neighborhood RON co-op. 
		</p>
		<p>RON Co-op that owns the shared building space and the common outdoor space.  The shared buildings would often be buildings that were either donated or sold at very low cost by the city (perhaps after taking over abandoned buildings).   Buildings that were in too bad of shape to repair could be torn down using lead-safe deconstruction techniques (also creating jobs similar to those created by <a href='http://phghouse.org/public/working/'>click</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Residents and external organizations would work to clean up and build the shared spaces as a way to improve the value of all the properties in the neighborhood and to make it valuable to be part of the RON co-op.  </p>
	</div>


	<h1 id="linkthree">Rent to Ownership</h1>

	<p>Shifting payments for housing from rent to ownership is an important part of building a strong local economy and asset building in low-income communities
Estimates are that about 35 percent of black households spend 50% of their income on housing.  If that is being extracted from the local economy, which is often the case, then it makes building personal or community wealth building very difficult. 
Building household wealth through home ownership is an important way to develop generational wealth that can be passed on to kids and it is a form of asset building that works even if people are not good at personal financial management. 
	</p>

<h1 id="linkfour">Build Local Economy</h1>

<p>Building a more vibrant local economy can be enhanced by reducing money going out of the economy. This can easy be obtained by shifting from renting properties to owning them. Helping small businesses start up can aslo help residents create wealth for them selfs and inevitbly enhancing the local neigborhood economy. Ways to achieve this would include keeping cost down or lower than normal, getting subsidies, leveraging collaborative purchasing to keep cost low and many other solution.
	</p><h1 id="linkfive">Anchor Neighbor</h1><p>
	Anchor neighbors are people who are specifically recruited to be some of the key neighbors on each block, and they are provided with added support to make the blocks safe and engaged.  In return, they get the benefit of a healthy and connected neighborhood where their home equity grows rapidly, giving them greater financial security and greater motivation to stay and help make the neighborhood even stronger. 
Anchor neighbors would be like the co-captains for the blocks and would be intentional and pro-active in helping neighbors get to know one another and to leverage their respective strengths.  
They would also be key to getting communications to the neighbors via calls, e-mails group texts, etc.   
They might work together on a block newsletter or other such things. 
Anchor neighbors would be the contact people for when other organizations are volunteering to help in a neighborhood.  

	</p><p>
	Some examples for anchor neighborhoods would be recently-returning veterans
The veterans would be supported by local (and national) veteran-serving organizations and would have a clear identity (jackets, shirts, hats, etc.) and regular meetings to plan out their strategy for improving neighborhood safety.
